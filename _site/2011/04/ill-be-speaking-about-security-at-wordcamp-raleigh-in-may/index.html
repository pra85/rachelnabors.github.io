        <p>I'll be giving a talk on<em> Simple Steps to WordPress Security</em> at <a href="http://wordcampraleigh.com/">WordCamp Raleigh</a> on Saturday, May 1st, from 11am to 12pm. Check out the<a href="http://wordcampraleigh.com/schedule/"> other excellent WordPress talks on the event's schedule page</a>. There are topics covering all skill levels, from blogger to web master! Be sure to <a href="http://wordcampraleigh.com/register/">register</a> ahead of time! Tickets are $45 and help pay for the venue, a shirt, and lunch.</p>

<p>I'll be covering three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Why security is important</strong> (surprisingly, at WordPress meets, people seem more interested in hearing about plugins than securing their sites--this is why hackers don't feel bad about ruining their digital lives)</li>
  <li><strong>Simple things your grandpa can do </strong>to lock down his WordPress install</li>
  <li><strong>DIY WordPress security</strong>, for more advanced users who aren't afraid of a little FTP, htaccess files and tweaking their databases.</li>
</ol>


<p>Come, join me, and we shall make the Internet a safer, less hackable space!</p>
