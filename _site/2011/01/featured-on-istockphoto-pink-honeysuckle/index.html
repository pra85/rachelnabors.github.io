        <p>Pantone declared "Honeysuckle" 2011's color of the year. It's a reddish pink, not unlike the one you see here. A few weeks ago, I was interviewed by a blogger from istockphoto about why I chose this particular shade of pink to represent my site. You can find the <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=952">full article along with examples of several other pink web site designs at istockphoto</a>.</p>

<p>I've actually been using this color long before it was declared color of the year. What can I say? I'm always ahead of the time! (Although, I must admit that although Pantone touts Honeysuckle as "universally flattering," I know from experience that this particular shade is not as flattering to pale, blue-toned redheads as last year's turquoise was!)</p>
