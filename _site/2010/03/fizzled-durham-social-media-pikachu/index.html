				<p>Last year I was so dazzled by the speakers at <a href="http://igniteraleigh.com/">Ignite Raleigh</a> that I promised myself I would submit a presentation idea the next time around. A year later I submitted the talk below to Ignite Raleigh, but it was apparent that although it was was getting many votes, it would not make top ten. So when <a href="http://www.dan-london.com/">Dan London</a> approached me about giving said talk at <a href="http://www.fizzleddurham.com/">Fizzled Durham</a>, I was immediately on board!</p>

<p>I offered to go first to help break the ice and calm my nerves for the rest of the night. I even got a few laughs out of the crowd! All in all,Â  I think I did well for someone who hasn't given a talk to a room of strangers since grade school. But to be sure I covered all before I went live, I did a test run at Slideshare and passed it around to friends to proofread. This version still has some typos, but I'll try to upload a rectified version after this crazy week is over! <a title="Fizzled Durham 2010: Social Media and Pikachu" href="http://www.slideshare.net/CrowChick/fizzled-durham-2010-social-media-and-pikachu-3358162">Check it out!</a></p>

<p>The presentation was much shorter than I had originally made it. My original took 9 minutes! So I had to cut a lot of more in depth bits. I didn't even get to go into how the latest generation of Pokemon games ship with a pedometer that allows you to <em>take the game with you</em> while you walk and play! (I cannot wait for my preorder!)</p>
