        <description>To kick off my 28th year, I’m stepping down from my positions as lead front-end developer at ruzuku and as co-organizer of Refresh the Triangle. I feel like for most of my career I’ve been doing a lot of Doing, and right now I really want to spend some time Learning and Creating. So I’m taking a breather to do just that. Also, we’re moving to New York City as soon as I find a job there.</description>

        <description>I always thought I was bad at JavaScript. It turned out I was just trying to read books that were way above my learning level. I don't have a programming background like the authors of those books, so I only started making headway after coming at the problem from a different, more fun angle.</description>

        <description>CSS Dev Conf was just wow. I had a blast and got to meet so many intelligent and witty CSS lovers. My talk on CSS animations was a hit. The ocean tried to kill me. And I broke out in hives. I'd do it all again!</description>

As a person who builds the Internet, it was interesting to connect with the people who write the Internet. (And I got this great picture of me and Twilight Sparkle to show for it!)</description>

        <description>Midwest UX was the best conference I have been to yet, period. It was organized and run like a well-oiled machine, surprising in such a young conference. I was able to meet many people I have only know on Twitter and made friends with many more I have never known before. In spite of a freak cold snap, I survived, pirate boots and all.</description>

        <description>Sometimes I have to be firm with myself to release projects, even if I'm tempted to keep pushing deadlines back in hopes of achieving 'perfection.' But today's perfection is tomorrow's failure. Weigh your time, your manpower, and the needs of your users against your to-do list, and don't shortchange the most important people in the equation to satisfy your own sense of achievement.</description>

        <description>I have complained that the HTML5 spec is too blog-centric ever since my beloved dialong tag got cut. But apparently it's not blog-centric enough to have a comment tag. In HTML5, we're supposed to markup comments as articles nested within the article they comment on. I see a number of ways this method could fail, both in implementation and interpretation.</description>

        <description>Recently at the Web Professional's Book Club some of my cohorts professed a lack of faith in "UX" or "User Experience" professionals, casting them alongside SEO salesmen. I was shocked. In all my career, I have always looked up to UXers as a sort of glowing stag in the forest of the Internet. We are surrounded by bad design and clumsy interfaces. I always imagined user experience designers as the people behind the bright spots on the Internet, a force to be respected and emulated. So naturally I was a bit bewildered. Do we really need User Experience Designers? I think so.</description>

        <description>When we must confront something negative, like letting a client down on a deadline, or telling a junior to get back to work on a task, we want to slither away and hide under a rock until... until what? The difficulty passes? It doesn't pass. It just gets bigger and harder to avoid.</description>

        <description>I do not think responsive design a the be-all and end-all solution for the mobile web, and by "mobile web" I mean "the web on small screens over sluggish connections." But I think media queries are actually one of the best things to happen to web design in recent years, right up there with decent font embedding.</description>

        <description>I am deeply disappointed in some of my fellow designers and developers. There seems to be trend of shifting blame from ourselves to the people who use our sites. I hear lots of whining about how "Internet Explorer broke my design!" and "Why would anyone ever use our site without JavaScript enabled? We don't need to have a fallback process. That's more work." Oh noes! I think that's a bum attitude. Commence ranting...</description>

        <description>Before designing my web comics site, I ran two reader surveys. Hearing what readers have to say can only help you build a better site. This first survey reveals how my readership has changed over the years and what site they're using. Some things I was expecting, but there were some surprises and revelations as well.</description>

        <description>I've been wanting to get back to drawing web comics for some time now. But first I need to build and design a new site to put them on. This is the first in a series of posts chronicling building my web comics site, from concept, to reader surveys, to design and completion.</description>

        <description>I'm a front-end designer. When I go to Refresh, a local web design/development meetup, and the host asks the crowd who's a developer and who's a designer, I never know when to raise my hand. Just what is a front-end designer/developer anyway?</description>

        <description>I love reading books, specifically books relating to my craft, even tagentially. So I started a book club for web professionals in the Triangle/Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill/Carborro area. Who is a web professional? Web pros are designers, developers, project managers and marketers. Our first meet is on the 19th, where we review Steve Krug's "Rocket Surgery Made Easy."</description>

        <description>I used to say that there were only three real uses for Flash: media players, animations, and games. (Everything else can be replicated with jQuery and AJAX.) These were the fingers with which Flash clung to the Internet. But one by one, they are being stomped on by HTML 5 and Javascript. And now that the ipad and iphone don't support Flash, the tide is begining to turn for Adobe's darling. Share with me this moment of schadenfreude...</description>

        <description>When I fell in love with my new smart car, I knew I had to create a blog all about the experience of owning one of these beauties. Little did I realize that lovemysmartcar.com would prove instrumental in dousing the flames of a viral if not inflammatory photograph. This site is a case in point for how social media can be used to deter viral bad press.</description>

        <description>WordPress has a bad reputation for getting hacked. It's opensource, so anyone can figure out how it works and where it's weaknesses are. And most new owners don't take very basic measures to protect themselves because they don't know how. So here's an excerpt from my resource Essential WordPress Plugins to help guide would-be victims.</description>

        <description>These are basic plugins that I can't imagine installing Wordpress without, plugins which improve performance, secure, or otherwise basically improve Wordpress's work functionality. I thought I would list them here, because in my searches for top 10 plugins, I have not found a list quite like this. Consider it a basic 14.</description>
