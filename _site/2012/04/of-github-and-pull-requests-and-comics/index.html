				<p>A few months ago I decided I wanted to contribute to projects on GitHub. I admit I was largely inspired to do so when, after signing up at coderwall, <a href="http://coderwall.com/rachelnabors">my profile page</a> was bereft of contribution badges. The talks I'd given, the meetups I'd organized and faithfully attended, the comics I'd made: none of it was gonna get me my hutzpah badge. If I wanted coderwall-approved geek cred, I needed to knuckle down and give back to the community, damn it.</p>

<p>I asked my coworkers of the time how I should start. I was admonished, "When you see something broken, fork it, fix it, and submit a pull request." Simple enough! Err, not so...</p>

<p><img title="GitHub Comic" alt="A comic in which the heroine, Rachel the Great, wants to submit pull requests to GitHub, but is thwarted by style guides and her own bumbling." src="http://www.rachelnabors.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/github_web1.png" /></p>

<p>Not a single one of my pull requests made it in! So where did I go wrong?</p>

<p>Before I submitted my first ever pull request, I was super nervous. What if I submitted it wrong? What if there was some hidden etiquette I didn't know about? What if I was about to breach protocol in such a way that would get me shunned from coder society <strong>for the rest of my life?</strong> Another of my coworkers (who shall remain anonymous to protect him from vicious opensource reprisals) said, "You're doing work for free. A project owner would have to be a real asshole to get pissed off that someone's working on their own time to try to help their project." That made a lot of sense to me, and I submitted the request (which was later politely rejected).</p>

<p>All the rejections were polite. All of them were justified. I felt like I'd run headfirst into a brick wall. Some of the repos were actively soliciting pull requests for things like documentation. Others, I was just trying to pitch in. Once someone pointed out their style guide to me, but most of them had no formalized policy on pull requests or process--at least not in shiny, bright red letters wrapped in a blink tag.</p>

<p>I bemoaned my situation on Twitter, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/averydistracted">Doug Avery</a> replied thusly:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/rachelnabors">rachelnabors</a> personally, i get irked when people pull without emailing me first or filing an issue to discuss. but i guess it's contextual</p>&mdash; Doug N. Avery (@averyquery) <a href="https://twitter.com/averyquery/status/189450321246949376">April 9, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>I'm supposed to email people first? Have I been the Crazy Pull-Request-without Emailing-First Lady?</p>

<p><a href="http://jacksonfox.org/">Jackson Fox</a> put out the good word and helped rustle up this <a href="http://wordsbyf.at/2012/02/13/creating-issues/">handy post on the topic of GitHub issues and pull requests</a>.</p>

<p>I feel like we've just scratched the surface, though. Do you maintain a repo? Do you contribute to one? What do you want do-gooder, hutzpah-badge-questing would-be contributors to know before they submit pull requests?</p>
