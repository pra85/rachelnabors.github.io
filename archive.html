        Rather than pruning the old posts that don't fit where I am today, for my 30th birthday I decide to convert my blog archive into an illustrated history of my journey through web development. Please enjoy.

                <img src="/img/graphics/il_2008.png" alt="An illustration of Rachel sitting,disheartened, under a tattered 'Welcome to Web Development!' banner as a cloud of Recession rains down from overhead, ruining her laptop and cartooning supplies." />
                <figcaption>
                  After many years of building and maintaining sites for my comics and fanbase, <a href="https://medium.com/@rachelnabors/dont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2">I leave all that behind and enter the world of professional web development</a>. The Recession hits in time for me to lose my first job as a web designer. I try my hand at freelancing as &ldquo;The Pink Crow&rdquo; because I love crows. Many of these entries are ported from that site.

                <img src="/img/graphics/il_2009.png" alt="An illustration of Rachel zipping about in a smart car, exclaiming that meetups are so much easier to get to now." />
                <figcaption>
                  Freelancing in a recession is tough, so I head in-house at an adult advertising company as sole on-site web designer. (As the saying goes, any port in a storm.) While gatekeeper to mounds of CSS, I dig deep into front-end development and make fast friends with the developers. Fall in love with WordPress and my new smart car.

                <figcaption>
                  <p>While archiving <a href="http://www.rachelthegreat.com/">my old comics</a>, I sieze the chance to perform the user surveys and studies I can't do at my day job due to the major privacy and content concerns that come with the adult industry online. In the process, I learn much about how people have begun reading comics on screens.</p>
                  <p>To spend more time with my local web dev community, I start the Web Professional's Book Club. I give some lightning talks at a few local marketing events. Longer talks are hard to find venues for. My employer's industry unnerves organizers. I don't blame them.</p>
                  <p>I have major jaw surgery. While recovering, I have a long think.</p>

                <img src="/img/graphics/il_2011.png" alt="An illustration of Rachel in a hat with her scarf covering her face saying now that she's had surgery, things are going to change." />
                <figcaption>
                  I leave my job for one at an agency that will let me use Sass and learn Ruby. No longer in the adult advertising industry, I'm able to start giving talks longer than 5 minutes. I'm determined to work with code for a living because it's fun and the earnings potentials are higher than they are for designers. My book club takes over the local Refresh when its organizers retire. We give the meetup a fantastic run that's still spoken of in hushed awe in dark corners of North Carolina.

                <figcaption>
                  だめだった。I start working at a startup founded by people I admire. All is well until I give my first Big Talk at the first CSS Dev Conf (in Hawaii). Afterward, my insatiable curiosity about web animation consumes me. I learn a valuable lesson: perfect coworkers are no replacement for engaging work. I am deeply sad to go but know I must. I'm on a mission. I've found my purpose. I've fallen in love with web animation. We elope.

                  The year of interviews: I travel the country looking for The Perfect Job (where I can work with web animation extensively). Most companies would rather I focused Angular. Finding my JavaScript chops need improving, I redouble my efforts to learn it inside and out. In the end, I don't accept any job offers and have a long think.

                  I decide <a href="/2014/07/14/bootstrapping-tinmagpie/">I'll start my own company</a>. We move to Portland, Oregon, and I travel the world to speak. I make friends, have adventures, give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9CB7EiU9xg">my first keynote at OSCON</a>. I give web animation workshops to help cover the expenses of all this traveling and making talks. It's hard work, but I feel truly alive and happy. It reminds me of hustling at comic conventions.
