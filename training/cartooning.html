<div class="entry-content">
<p>January's class filled right up, so I've opened registration for a February class! I'm so happy you're as excited as I am!</p>
<p>I've done a lot of workshops on everything from teaching web animation to developers to teaching designers JavaScript, but at every conference, I hear, "I wish I could draw like you! I love comics, and they're so easy to understand." So I thought that should be my next workshop! I've been giving informal cartooning classes at conferences, and people really dig the chance to learn a few comics principles and how they apply to every day communication and design challenges. I've been plotting out a larger curriculum ever since!</p>

<h2>Payment levels</h2>
<p>There are three different levels, but you'll all be equals in class &amp; my eyes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>$300 The Budding Cartoonist</strong> You get the course, my full attention and undying love!</li>
  <li><strong>$500 Le Artiste</strong> I will send you an <strong>art supply kit that contains every tool</strong> I will suggest you use. No scrounging around the office for hot pink markers! Plus, you will get <strong>one hour of pair cartooning</strong> with yours truly. This is a one-on-one session we were screen share and solve visual problems together. Great if you need a little boost in the courage department.</li>
  <li><strong>$700 The Beret</strong> This level gets a special <strong>bonus week of storyboarding</strong> education and practice. Storyboards are excellent tools for communicating a journey through an experience, be it an animated feature film or a complex, branching application. Not only do you get everything outlined above, but I'll also send you <strong>your very own beret to wear,</strong> during class, around the office&mdash;they are quite good at keeping the rain out of your glasses, too! As a final bonus, I'll send along a code for my <strong><a href="http://frontendmasters.com/courses/animation-storytelling-html5-css3/cutout-animations-css/?partner=1">Frontend Masters CSS Animation Masterclass</a>.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>Class Size</h2>
<p>I wanted to keep class size small so I can give you proper attention and feedback, so class is limited to fifteen participants.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>You will need to be able to participate via Google+, as all group discussion, feedback, videos, and live hangouts will occur in a private Google+ community. The class will be broken up into a few large segments, and I'll record instructions on video that you can watch at any time. There will be live Hangouts on Air where you can ask me your questions and get feedback live, or you can engage with me and your fellow participants in the discussion rooms. To get the most of this experience, you will want to upload scans, pictures or images of your work for feedback from me and other class members.</p>

<p>There are a few questions on the registration form that will help me organize live events and portion the information to work best for everyone's schedules and time restrictions.</p>

<h2>Length</h2>
<p>The class is four weeks long and starts in the beginning of February. Time commitment is about 3-5 hours a week, depending on your level of engagement.</p>
