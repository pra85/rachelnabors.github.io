Good news, everyone! I'm speaking at <a href="http://cssdevconf.com/">CSS Dev Conf</a> in Hawaii in December!

<a href="http://www.rachelnabors.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cssdevconf_game.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-728" title="CSS Dev Conf Speakers" src="http://www.rachelnabors.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cssdevconf_game-595x1024.jpg" alt="Speakers at CSS Dev Conf. I am one." /></a>

("That squirrel guy" is <a href="http://cssquirrel.com/">Kyle Weems of CSSquirrel</a> notoriety.) Now, I'm trying not to squee too much here, but <a href="http://sched.cssdevconf.com/directory/speakers#.UE5s66TyZrA">look at those speakers</a>: <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Estelle Weyl</a>, <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="http://snook.ca/">Jonathan Snook</a>... <em>I have read books by these people.</em> I have two words for you: <strong>performance anxiety.</strong>

I'll be showing people how to make a <a href="http://sched.cssdevconf.com/event/eaf406a94449d904a1f82878ac76577c#.UE5rpqTyZrA">Music Videos with CSS3 and HTML5.</a> You might have seen my<a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/700652-Catwalk"> messing around with various assets over at dribbble</a>. That's the hard part. The assets. I know what I can do. I have it storyboarded. It's making and getting all the graphics in one place--and then showing people how I'm manipulating them in the browser. I've never given a talk like that before, so I've been studying <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2012/06/so-youve-been-invited-to-speak/">Lea Verou</a> very closely.

I have <del>three</del> four questions for you:
<ol>
  <li>What should I know about Hawaii before visiting? I've never been there before. I'm not staying long.</li>
  <li>If Kyle and I did a joint session/project/something, what would you like to see us do? A cartoonist duel? Rapping battle?</li>
  <li>What ways have you seen people show intense in-browser graphics alongside code?</li>
  <li>The CSS I'll be writing live will have a <strong>lot of vendor prefixes.</strong> But I want people to see the CSS3, not the browsers! Should I use <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass mixins</a> or <a href="http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/">-prefix-free</a>? Compass would be more interesting for people learning about CSS precompilers and would help me demonstrate just how many vendor prefixes this sort of thing takes. But -prefix-free would help keep people focused on the structure of the CSS--and how it <em>should</em> look in upcoming years.</li>
</ol>
<div>Also, I have a <strong>coupon code</strong> for you! Get <strong>$50 off</strong> the price of a ticket merely by uttering my name on signup: <strong><strong></strong>RACHEL</strong></div>
I have to go finish that walk cycle now... and start building the stage.
