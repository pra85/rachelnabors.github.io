title: Hello, World.
excerpt: These are basic plugins that I can't imagine installing Wordpress without, plugins which improve performance, secure, or otherwise basically improve Wordpress's work functionality. I thought I would list them here, because in my searches for top 10 plugins, I have not found a list quite like this. Consider it a basic 14.

It's not my <em>first post</em>, but it is close to it! Welcome to my new blog-folio. I will be posting useful articles about things related to CSS, front end design, usability, and so on, mainly for the benefit of my friends and colleagues. Hopefully the rest of the Internet will find something of interest here as well.

Additionally, I will have a portfolio set up to showcase my work and a freebies section where I will give away Photoshop brushes and the like.

Please have fun, and remember, I'll always love to hear your thoughts on this and any of my projects. If you have a free moment, feel free to stop by my other site, <a href="http://subcultureofone.com">SubcultureOfOne.com</a>, to read some free comics.
