I wrote two articles for UX Booth about comics and UX: <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/comics-and-ux-part-1-cross-disciplinary-techniques/">Part 1: Cross-disciplinary Techniques</a> and <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/comics-and-ux-part-2-flow-and-content/">Part 2: Flow and Content</a>. Please check them out and let me know what you think! (I was kind of expecting to get beaten up by a bunch of content strategists for posting part 2...)
