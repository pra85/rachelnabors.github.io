Recently the awesome Andrew Maier of <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/">UX Booth</a> approached me about illustrating his article, <em><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/telling-your-websites-story-with-sketchboarding/">Telling Your Website's Story with Sketchboarding</a> </em>(because of my <a href="http://rachelthegreat.com">comicking background</a>, I imagine). I was only too happy to oblige! Below is an uncut version of two comics that got turned into one:

There are <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/telling-your-websites-story-with-sketchboarding/">more comics in the article</a>. Andrew did a great job, so give it a read!
