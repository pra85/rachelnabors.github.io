title: What's a front end designer/developer?
excerpt: I'm a front-end designer. When I go to Refresh, a local web design/development meetup, and the host asks the crowd who's a developer and who's a designer, I never know when to raise my hand. Just what is a front-end designer/developer anyway?

<strong>Update Jan 24, 2011 </strong>Yet another term: <a href="http://www.computedstyle.com/2010/12/hiring-front-end-engineers.html">"front-end engineer" appears in this excellent write-up on what qualities to look for when hiring a front-ender.</a> Do give it a read.

I consider myself a front-end designer. When I go to Refresh, a local web design/development meetup, and the host asks the crowd who's a developer and who's a designer, I never know when to raise my hand. True, I design a lot of things. But at my day job, I rarely design an entire site from top to bottom (with the exception of our mobile site). Usually I work with a team to design something. I'm rarely the star of the show, but I don't mind because I believe great things can come from team work. And while I do much with markup and code, I don't feel like a developer either, because I don't build PHP newsletter applications on a regular basis. So just what <em>is</em> a front-end designer/developer? And which is it, developer or designer?

To me, a front-end designer should:
<ul>
  <li>Be able to design a site or edit a pre-exisiting site's design</li>
  <li>Collect and analyze analytics</li>
  <li>Run an A/B test</li>
  <li>Run an ad-hoc user testing session</li>
  <li>Build site concepts based on what users want <em>and</em> need</li>
  <li>Have excellent, accessible, semantic, lightweight, yummy, master-level, cutting edge and beyond HTML/CSS skills</li>
  <li>Bring the AJAX and jQuery</li>
  <li>Wrangle at least one CMS, preferably more.</li>
  <li>Craft a mobile version of a site.</li>
</ul>
So what do you think a front-ender is? Or is it a completely arbitrary title?
