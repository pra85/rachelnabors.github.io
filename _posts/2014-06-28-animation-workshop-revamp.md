This October I'm giving my Web Animations Masterclass at [Fronteers in Amsterdam](https://fronteers.paydro.net/) and at [CSS Dev Conf in New Orleans](http://2014.cssdevconf.com/#register). This is the same course I gave at [Front End Masters a year ago](http://frontendmasters.com/courses/animation-storytelling-html5-css3/cutout-animations-css/?partner=1), and since then I've revised and improved portions of it.

But recently there've been some rather massive shifts on the web animations front. I plan to remove some sections of the workshop and replace them with information I'm certain attendees will need to know in the coming years, such as:

* What is <code>will-change</code> and when can it improve performance?
* The Web Animation API, what can and can't it do?

(I'll also be giving out subscriptions to Front End Masters at the workshops!)

What would _you_ like me to cover in this workshop?
