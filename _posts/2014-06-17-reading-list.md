I've been nailing [one](http://2014.la-conf.org/) [conference](http://rustbeltrefresh.com/) after [the other](http://giantconf.com/) and falling a little out of the loop on the state of web animations. So today I sat myself down and started reading the following articles to get up to speed. Please enjoy with a nice hot cup of whatever you please!

* [Web Animations - element.animate() is now in Chrome 36](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/05/Web-Animations---element-animate-is-now-in-Chrome-36) _HTML5 Rocks_&mdash;It appears the Web Animation API implementation is finally getting underway! And thus, it's time for me to seriously update my Animation Masterclass for this fall to properly introduce it (giving this workshop at [Fronteers in Amsterdam](https://fronteers.paydro.net/) and [CSS Dev Conf in Louisana](http://2014.cssdevconf.com/#footer-wrapper), both in October). While this is a simple how-to article requesting implementors like myself to kick the tires, the more interesting and perhaps distressing part of the page is in the comments section. There's a lot of push back from people using libraries with more or less understanding of the the Web Animation API. My opinion? I see commercial animation libraries as a stepping stone to a universal API. The last time we had a commercial web animation product&hellip; it didn't do so well when manufacturers abandoned it. My hope is that we can learn from Flash's challenges and build something together&mdash;that we support together.
* [HTML5 Needs a New Animation API to Compete with Native](http://marcgrabanski.com/html5-animation-api/) _Marc Grabanski_&mdash;Marc came back from HTML5 Dev Conf with some thoughts on the Web Animation API. Many people weigh in in the comments. I still need to finish reading all of it. Maybe time for a bubble bath?
* [Everything You Need to Know About the CSS will-change Property](http://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/) _Sara Soueidan_&mdash;Best coverage about the new <code>will-change</code> CSS property; easy to enjoy with a long cup of tea on a rainy day. Will be including this in the workshop update.
* [Sassy Z-Index Management For Complex Layouts](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/12/sassy-z-index-management-for-complex-layouts/) _Smashing Magazine_&mdash;Holy crow, this would have been a blessing to work with on the [latest Black Brick Road, a drag-and-drop room game](http://rachelnabors.com/blackbrickroad/) with way more absolutely positioned objects than anyone should have to deal with!
* [Whatâ€™s left in making movie projections a lifelike illusion?](http://paulbakaus.com/2013/01/09/making-movie-watching-a-lifelike-illusion/) _Paul Bakaus_&mdash;Paul sees the browser as more than just a document reader, too. So when he's sniffing around cinematography, he's sure to dig up something interesting. Posts like this get me thinking.

And as far as proper books go, I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812993012/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812993012&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mangapunk-20&amp;linkId=2B2DSOD5DTQZAFEO">Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mangapunk-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0812993012" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, one of the founders of Pixar. It's pretty inspiring stuff, given that I'm starting my own company. But more on that later!

So how about you? What are _you_ reading?
