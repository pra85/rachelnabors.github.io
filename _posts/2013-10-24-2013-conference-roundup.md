##Issues
*_Charging me for my hotel room by accident._ There's a reason I can't go to conferences that don't pay for my hotel room: I can't afford it. So when I end up with hundreds of dollars of charges on my card for a room that was supposed to be covered ("We just need your card for confirmation, ma'am."), it creates __no end of consternation__ for me. In the middle of the conference, I'll have to bother the organizers about it when I should be prepping my talk. And it creates a whole new invoicing task for me when I get home. In short: charging me for a comped room causes me pain. Do whatever it takes to make sure it __never__ happens, and if it does, get that reimbursement check in the mail as soon as you get off the plane.
