Paul Irish's 60 fps talk @ CSS Dev Conf 2012

- Reflows: when the page gets repainted because of an architectural change.
	- see cssreflow.com--doesn't work anymore.
	- Tool is MIA

- Jank: jitteriness in transitions and animations
	- thought they were just being picky but CANNOT UNSEE
	- 

Frame Busget: Amount of time to do stuff before browser sends things to screen.
	- Mostly 60fps, but sometimes as low as 50, as high as 120!
	- 16.6666666667ms to do things in before browser sends to the GPU
	- Do not use setTimeout--it will slowly synch out.
		- You will lose a frame
		- Visually it looks like it gets slower and slower then jumps that frame.

RequestAnimationFrame()
	- Hey, I got screen updates guys! see stellar.js backgrounds demo
	Scrollling
	- When you use rAF w. scroll instead of just using scroll, you get smoover results
	- better for batteries
	(so glad I made this one)
	- the browser "vsyncs" to the refresh rate of the monitor

Other Jank:
- garbage collection
- JS timers
- XHR
- Heavy DOM manip

Timeline VIEWWWWW!
	- Timeline -> Events -> Record -> Refresh
	- 3rd is purple = repainting
	- Use frames mode to see "tall bars" (which took a long time to finish)
	- Zoom in.

Smooth animation
	NOTICE: Currently CSS animation and JS use the same thread, but SOON:
	- CSS runs on its own thread with the browser's is busy.
	- On Chrome and Android first, everywhere else soon

Costly CSS properties
	- position:fixed (try sticky instead)
		- esp w/ transparency
	- fixed background
		- has to repaint instead of "just shift up"
	- border-radius
	- box-shadow
	- bg-size
